Reforestation Planning Tool

# Reforestation Planning Tool

## Overview

The **Reforestation Planning Tool** is a web application designed to assist in selecting optimal planting sites for agave plants, supporting ecological restoration efforts for **CABRA**, a sustainable outdoor apparel and equipment company based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The tool simulates the use of machine learning algorithms and cloud computing to analyze geospatial data, predict plant growth, and optimize resource allocation.

## Features

- **Optimal Planting Site Selection**
  - Analyze geospatial data such as soil quality, climate conditions, and topography.
  - Identify the best locations for agave planting using clustering algorithms like K-means.

- **Predictive Growth Modeling**
  - Simulate predictions of growth and survival rates of agave plants based on environmental data.
  - Utilize regression models like Random Forests and decision trees.

- **Efficient Resource Allocation**
  - Optimize the allocation of labor, water, and other resources.
  - Apply linear programming and optimization algorithms.

- **CSV Upload and Download**
  - Upload a CSV file containing geospatial data.
  - Simulate data analysis and provide a downloadable CSV file as a result.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js, React
- **Programming Language**: TypeScript
- **UI Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Charts and Visualization**: Chart.js, react-chartjs-2
- **Map Integration**: Leaflet, React-Leaflet
